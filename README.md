# Pneumonia Detection
## Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning approach to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The notebook (main_pneumonia.ipynb) contains the full pipeline, including dataset loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

The goal of this project is to assist medical practitioners and researchers by providing an AI-based tool for pneumonia detection, which can help in early diagnosis and treatment.

## Features

1. Preprocessing of chest X-ray images (resizing, normalization, augmentation).

2. Deep learning model (CNN / transfer learning such as VGG16, ResNet, etc.).

3. Training and validation with accuracy and loss plots.

4. Model evaluation using metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix).

5. Prediction function for new X-ray images.
